# PPJA Redux in Java Assets (UNOFFICIAL SDV MOD)
Basically the Java Assets version of the recent DGA version of PPJA, unofficial and fan-made. Features all of the Redux/DGA stuff in JA.

Things that it will do:

(General)
- Add likes/dislikes for Leo
- Add UniversalGiftTastes, for Likes or Neutral for NPCs
- Implement the letter backgrounds found in the DGA version
- Make the items gated behind the island letter move to the island shop
- Change Shane and Pam's alcohol gift presences to Dislike or Hate, and Leo to Hate
  
(Artisan Valley)
- Will add the Cafe au Lait and Dark Coffee items
- Will add the "peanut_butter_item" tag to Smooth Peanut Butter
- Will reimplement pepper extracts
- Will make ice creams and orange sherbert purchasable from the Ice Cream Stand

(Christmas Sweets)
- Will add the Christmas Pudding item
- Will make Harvey like sone cookies

(Even More Recipes)
- Will add the Blue Lemonade, Blue Slushie, Blue Tropical Juice, Coconut Milk, Purple Punch, Red Punch, Red Slushie, Red Tropical Juice, Sachertorte, Yellow Punch, and Yellow Tropical Juice items and recipes
- Makes concession items gated behind unlocking the Movie Theater

(Fantasy Crops)
- Will fix typo in crop descriptions
- Will rebalance gift taste values: Makes Doubloons universally Liked

(Farmer to FLorist)
- Will rebalance gift taste values: Makes the Dried Poison item no longer giftable
- Rebalance of sell prices for Year 1 flower crops so they aren't overpowered this time (140 gold for a 45-gold flower that grows in seven days? NUTS!) (Addition by me)

(Fresh Meat)
- Will add Chicken Wing and Drumstick drops to Chickens
- Will add Drumstick drops to Turkeys
- Will add the Cooked Mutton item, and recipies for Beef Taco, Cooked Chicken Wing, and Cooked Drumstick
- Will change the Coconut Curry sprite to the new sprite
- Will rebalance gift taste values: Shane will now Hate everything with chicken in it, the Wizard will Hate any raw, cooked, or by-product of Dragon & Phoenix, Linus now Likes raw meat and Love cooked meat, Willy will Love most seafood products, and Leo will Dislike bird-related meat and meat product.

(Fruits and Veggies)
- Will add the "bell_pepper_item" context tag
- Will add the Bay, Catnip (with the system of the price being 25 gold if your pet is a cat, or 50 if it's a dog), Carolina Reaper, Champagne Grape (with it's tag), Ghost Pepper, Poblano Chille, Scotch Bonnet, and Serrano Chile crops
- A system with the Bell Peppers that will produce the Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red Bell Peppers (hance the original name of the Bell Pepper will be Red Bell Pepper). I'm thinking about either a random chance on harvest to produce a yellow, orange, or red one if you are lucky, but you might get a green one instead (Doing the DGA system of harvesting these is possibly impossible with JA).
- (Addition by me) Green Bell Peppers will grant 60% of harvest rewards and sell price than Yellow, Orange, and Red ones
- Will change the Lettuce, Onion, and Red Onion sprites to the new sprites
- Will rebalance gift taste values: Leo will have simular gift tastes to Jas and Vincent, and will make Emily feel more positive about items related to clothing/sewing.

(Mizu's Flowers)
- Will merge seasonal Roses to a config option

(More Recipes)
- Will add the "peanut_butter_item" tag to Peanut Butter

- Will change the Asian Pear, Granny Smith Apple, Ume, and Yuzu sprites to the new sprites
- Will change the Avocado, Camphor, Cinnamon, Fig, Pear, and Persimmon tree sprites to the new tree sprites

(Starbrew Valley)
- Will rebalance gift tast values: Items such as Tonic and Seltzer Waters will be universally Disliked, Lewis will Hate and Marie will Dislike The Mayor's Shorts drink, and Penny will Dislike alcoholic beverages

(Tailor Mouse)
- Will add the MFM background from the DGA version
